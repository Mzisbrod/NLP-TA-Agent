I believe that w_i = \"fruit\" and t_i = \"N\" is sufficient in this case because all examples of \"fruit\" in the training data are of the form \"fruit/N. \" In the case of \"flies, \" for example, where both \"flies/V\" and \"flies/N\" appear in the training data, the corresponding feature functions include additional information (e. g. , w_{i-1}) that describe whether \"flies\" is being used as a noun or verb. 3) Like in the case of \"flies/N, \" in which there are two feature functions in the given solution (6, 7), we could have more than one w_i with time feature function if we chose to create one or more additional feature functions.",

Then, you can use the development set to tune these hyperparameters. Finally, you want to run an end-to-end evaluation using the test data. It's important that the test data is not touched during training and optimization at all. In this assignment, because you do not have to optimize any of the hyperparameters, we can get away with one held-out set. So you run your evaluation on . dev without ever touching . test. If you wanted to experiment more, I would recommend you repeat the evaluation on . dev and then run a final test on . text -- however that is not required for the assignment. "

            "For your first question: you need to count the number of word tokens (including duplicates). I was initially thinking about the case in which the context of a trigram is unseen. In that case you should use 1/V, where V contains all types in the lexicon. you can use len(lexicon) but you need to add 1 for the STOP symbol. For the second question: the corpus reader already takes care of replacing unknown tokens with UNK. You can therefore assume that all tokens have been seen.  There should be no 0 unigram probabilities. "

Professor mentions that it would overestimate the probability for unseen words (2hr 34min) , but doesn't the probability depend on count of words, so shouldn't the probability of seen words be higher. It would be helpful if you could correct me here and how this relates to Zipf's distribution. Thank you.",
        "comments": [],
        "answers": [
            "Here is my understanding. Not sure if it's correct. In the testing data, we might encounter tokens not observed in the training data. These 'unseen' tokens could lead to a 'divide by 0' error. Additive smoothing is applied to solve the issue by assigning a probability of 1/V to unseen words (the count of unseen words is zero). However, the actual probability of unseen words in real-life is likely much lower than 1/V because of Zipf's distribution.",
            "The way I thought of it is like inflation. Suppose you print some money and give everyone $1. Then the people who had more money to start with still have more money, but the value of a dollar decreases, so the people with $0 to start with have had their purchasing power disproportionately increased.",
            "So one question is what \"accurate\" means here. Additive smoothing gives you a probability distribution, in the sense that all event probabilities will sum to 1. 0. We don't know what the \"real\" probability for unseen events is -- if there even is such a thing. We assume these probabilities are not 0 and that, instead, we simply have not seen evidence for these events because the training data is too small. So we use smoothing to come up with an estimate. The main issue with additive smoothing is that it treats all unseen events the same and it redistributes too much probability mass from seen events, especially if you have a limited amount of training data. Assume you have seen the trigram \"like eating pizza\" once, but your test data contains the trigram \"like eating escargot\". Add-one smoothing would make \"escargot\" in this context half as likely as \"pizza\", when you would really expect it to be much more rare. "
